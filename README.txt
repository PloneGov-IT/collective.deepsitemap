Introduction
============


This is a sitemap replacement that:

 - shows only a branch of the tree, if called in a context different than the site root;
 - takes a 'sitemapDepth' request parameter, overriding the global one in navtree_properties.


Both features are available to users with the 'collective.deepsitemap: Use Deep Sitemap' permission (by default Manager).
